E-mail Client
=================

E-mail Client allows user to list out all messages, to click on an individual message to see the full body, and to "send" messages.

Features include [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com), [JQuery](http://jquery.com/),
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


Usage
-----

First, download the project to the desktop. Open a terminal window
and change the directory by entering `$ cd Desktop/e-mail`.
In order to run the app, start up a local web server.

On Macs, enter `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the terminal
window and navigate to *localhost:8000* in a web browser. For Windows,
download a program such as [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml), copy it to the project
folder, and double-click it to launch a server. Finally, open the page
in a browser.
